# Electron-React Application Template

This is a professional template for building cross-platform desktop applications using Electron, React, and JavaScript. It comes with a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, ensuring code quality and automated releases.

## Features

- üöÄ React for building dynamic user interfaces
- üñ•Ô∏è Electron for creating cross-platform desktop applications
- üé® Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive styling
- üìè ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting
- üß™ Jest for comprehensive testing
- üì¶ Electron Builder for packaging and distribution
- üîÑ GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline

## CI/CD Workflow

Our GitHub Actions workflow (`build.yml`) automates the following processes:

1. **Linting and Testing**: Ensures code quality and catches errors early.
2. **Building**: Compiles the React app and builds the Electron application.
3. **Deployment**: (Placeholder for your deployment logic)
4. **Release**: Automatically creates GitHub releases with built artifacts.
5. **Cleanup**: Manages workflow runs to keep the Actions tab tidy.

The workflow runs on push to the main branch, on pull requests, and can be triggered manually.

## Getting Started

1. Click the "Use this template" button to create a new repository from this template.
2. Clone your new repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run electron-dev
   ```

## Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the React development server
- `npm run build`: Builds the React app for production
- `npm test`: Runs the test suite
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues
- `npm run lint:fix`: Runs ESLint and attempts to fix issues automatically
- `npm run electron-dev`: Starts the Electron app in development mode
- `npm run electron-pack`: Packages the Electron app for distribution

## Customizing

- Update `package.json` with your app's details
- Modify the `build` section in `package.json` for custom Electron Builder configurations
- Edit `public/index.html` to change the HTML template
- Update `src/App.js` to modify the main React component
- Adjust `.github/workflows/build.yml` to customize the CI/CD pipeline
